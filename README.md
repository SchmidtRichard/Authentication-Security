# [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)

Use the npm init command to create a `package.json` file for your application.

```express
npm init -y
```

Install some packages(`express`, `ejs`, `body-parser` and `mongoose`)

```express
npm i express ejs body-parser mongoose
```

# Security Level 1 - The Lowest Level

Simply creating an account for the user to store the email & password into mongoDB (users collection)

## HTTP POST Request/POST Route Code Example

### POST Request to Register Route

```js
//POST request (register route) to post the username and password the user enter when registering
app.post("/register", function(req, res) {
  //Create the new user using the User model
  const newUser = new User({
    //Values from the userSchema checked against the register.ejs variables
    email: req.body.username,
    password: req.body.password
  });
  //Save the new user
  newUser.save(function(err) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      /*
      Only render the secrets page if the user is logged in
      that is why there is no app.get("/secrets")... route
      */
      res.render("secrets");
    }
  });
});
```

### POST Request to Login Route

```js
//POST request (login route) to login the user
app.post("/login", function(req, res) {
  //Check in mongoDB if the credentials entered exist in the DB
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;

  /*
  Check the details entered above (username & password)
  if the details exist in the DB and match what is in the DB
  Look through the collection of Users (User)
  */
  User.findOne({
    email: username
  }, function(err, foundUser) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
      /*
      If the user has been found in the DB
      Check if the password is correct, if correct render to the secrets page
      */
      if (foundUser) {
        if (foundUser.password === password) {
          res.render("secrets");
        }
      }
    }
  });
});
```

# Security Level 2 - [mongoose-encryption](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-encryption)

Simple encryption and authentication for mongoose documents. Relies on the Node `crypto` module. Encryption and decryption happen transparently during save and find. Rather than encrypting fields individually, this plugin takes advantage of the BSON nature of mongoDB documents to encrypt multiple fields at once.

## How it Works

Encryption is performed using AES-256-CBC with a random, unique initialization vector for each operation. Authentication is performed using HMAC-SHA-512.

## Installation

`npm install mongoose-encryption`

## Usage

Generate and store keys separately. They should probably live in environment variables, but be sure not to lose them. You can either use a single secret string of any length; or a pair of base64 strings (a 32-byte encryptionKey and a 64-byte signingKey).

### Basic

```js
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var encrypt = require('mongoose-encryption');

var userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    age: Number
    // whatever else
});

// Add any other plugins or middleware here. For example, middleware for hashing passwords

var encKey = process.env.SOME_32BYTE_BASE64_STRING;
var sigKey = process.env.SOME_64BYTE_BASE64_STRING;

userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { encryptionKey: encKey, signingKey: sigKey });
// This adds _ct and _ac fields to the schema, as well as pre 'init' and pre 'save' middleware,
// and encrypt, decrypt, sign, and authenticate instance methods

User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

And you're all set. `find` works transparently (though you cannot query fields that are encrypted) and you can make New documents as normal, but you should not use the `lean` option on a `find` if you want the document to be authenticated and decrypted. `findOne`, `findById`, etc..., as well as `save` and `create` also all work as normal. `update` will work fine on unencrypted and unauthenticated fields, but will not work correctly if encrypted or authenticated fields are involved.

### Encrypt Only Certain Fields

You can also specify exactly which fields to encrypt with the `encryptedFields` option. This overrides the defaults and all other options.

```js
// encrypt age regardless of any other options. name and _id will be left unencrypted
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { encryptionKey: encKey, signingKey: sigKey, encryptedFields: ['age'] });
```

### Secret String Instead of Two Keys

For convenience, you can also pass in a single secret string instead of two keys.

```js
var secret = process.env.SOME_LONG_UNGUESSABLE_STRING;
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, { secret: secret });
```

## Mongoose Encryption Code

```js
/*Replace the simple version of the schema above to the below one
The userSchema is no longer a simple javascript object,
it is now an object create from the mongoose.Schema class
*/
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: String,
  password: String
});

/*
Mongoose Encryption Secret String
It defines a secret (a long unguessable string) then uses this secret to encrypt the DB
*/
const secret = "Thisisourlittlesecret.";
/*
Use the secret to above to encrypt the DB by taking the userSchema and add
mongoose.encrypt as a plugin to the schema and pass over the secret as a JS object

It is important to add the plugin before the mongoose.model

Encrypt Only Certain Fields (password) -> encryptedFields: ['password']
*/
userSchema.plugin(encrypt, {
  secret: secret,
  encryptedFields: ['password']
});
```
